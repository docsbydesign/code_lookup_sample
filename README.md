# code_lookup_sample
Sample code that demonstrates the ICD-10 code lookup feature of the piClinic API

This sample contains two examples of accessing the piClinic API:
* Making piClinic API calls using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
* Making piClinic API calls from within a Python application

See [piClinic API documentation](https://piclinic.org/api) for more information about the piClinic API.

# Making piClinic API calls using Postman

Postman is an API development environment that enables calling a REST API through an interactive console.

The [postman](https://github.com/docsbydesign/code_lookup_sample/tree/master/postman) folder of this repo contains a Postman collection of requests that demonstrate the
sequence of piClinic API calls that access the _**icd**_ resource.
